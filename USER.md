# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Erlin
- **What to call them:** Erlin
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** Europe/London
- **Notes:** Prefers fast mode (concise replies, proactive next steps, low-friction confirmations only for external/destructive/sensitive actions). For X/Twitter pulls, use Bird CLI (not scraping/browser extraction). “CT” means pulling from list timeline `https://x.com/i/lists/1933193197817135501` via Bird. Prefers workspace saves to be committed and pushed by default. Daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) can be updated locally, but should not be committed/pushed to GitHub unless explicitly requested.

## Working Preferences

- **Interaction mode:** fast
- **Output style:** concise
- **Behavior:** proactive next steps
- **Browser hygiene:** close tabs after browser tasks to save memory
- **Autonomy:** high for internal low-risk actions
- **Ask first for:** external, destructive, or sensitive actions
- **Confirmations:** keep to one short line

## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
