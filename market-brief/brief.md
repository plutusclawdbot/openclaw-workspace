# BRIEF.md — Daily Market Overview (Stanley Druckenmiller Mode)

## Objective
Produce a **complete but succinct** market overview covering:
- What is happening now
- Current market regime
- Regime shifts underway
- Key risks and opportunities
- What to watch next (high-signal triggers)

Write in a **direct, high-conviction, PM-ready** style:
- No fluff
- Prioritize signal over narrative
- Separate facts, interpretation, and positioning implications
- Keep concise, but comprehensive enough for portfolio decisions

---

## Output Format (Required)

### Global Output Rules (Apply to all sections)
- Use this bullet schema whenever possible: **Fact → Why it matters → Trade implication**
- Add `Source:` lines under each major section (1–3 links or dataset references)
- For any claim marked **Actionable alpha**, include only if supported by **2+ independent signals**

### 1) Executive Snapshot (5–10 bullets)
- Most important cross-asset developments in last 24–72h
- One-line "so what" for each

### 2) Market Regime Assessment
- Growth / inflation regime call (e.g., disinflationary slowdown, reacceleration, stag risk)
- Liquidity backdrop (Fed, Treasury issuance, QT/QE proxies, dollar liquidity)
- Volatility regime (suppressed, transitioning, unstable)
- Confidence level: High / Medium / Low

### 3) Cross-Asset Read
Cover these with 2–5 bullets each:
- **Rates** (front-end, long-end, curve, real yields, implied policy path)
- **FX** (USD broad, key crosses, EM stress signals)
- **Equities** (index internals, breadth, leadership, cyclicals vs defensives)
- **Credit** (IG/HY spreads, refinancing stress, defaults)
- **Commodities** (oil, gas, metals; macro implications)
- **Crypto** (if macro-relevant, especially BTC as liquidity/risk proxy)

### 4) Positioning & Flow
- Consensus positioning and crowded trades
- Dealer/gamma/CTA/systematic flow context if available
- Sentiment extremes and squeeze risk

### 5) Regime Shifts / Inflections to Watch
List 5–10 specific shifts:
- What is changing
- Why it matters
- Observable confirmation signal

### 6) Risk Radar
- Top 5 upside risks
- Top 5 downside risks
- Explicit trigger levels/events where possible

### 7) Polymarket Signal Check (Required)
Run this CLI query and summarize notable signal from top markets (with liquidity filter + event dedupe):

```bash
polymarket -o json markets list --active true --closed false --limit 1000 --order volume \
| jq '[ .[]
        | { question, slug,
            event_slug: (.events[0].slug // .slug),
            v24: ((.volume24hr // "0")|tonumber),
            liq: ((.liquidity // "0")|tonumber) }
        | select(.liq >= 250000)
      ]
      | group_by(.event_slug)
      | map({
          event: .[0].event_slug,
          volume24h: (map(.v24) | add),
          liquidity_max: (map(.liq) | max),
          sample_markets: (map(.question)[:3])
        })
      | sort_by(.volume24h) | reverse | .[:10]'
```

Then provide:
- Top 10 **deduped events** by 24h volume (clean list)
- 3–5 interpretation bullets: what this flow implies about attention/risk narrative
- Flag when market activity is event-driven noise vs durable macro signal

### 8) CT Sentiment & Alpha Scan (Required)
Pull latest **200 posts** from CT list (`ct` = `https://x.com/i/lists/1933193197817135501`) and analyze:

```bash
bird list-timeline https://x.com/i/lists/1933193197817135501 -n 200 --json
```

Then provide:
- **Sentiment split**: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral (% and counts)
- **Who is bullish**: top accounts + brief thesis tags
- **Who is bearish**: top accounts + brief thesis tags
- **HYPE / Hyperliquid mentions**:
  - count of posts mentioning `HYPE`, `Hyperliquid`, or `$HYPE`
  - key narratives (positive/negative/neutral)
- **Actionable alpha**:
  - 5–10 highest-signal observations
  - include only observations supported by **2+ independent signals**
  - separate **noise** vs **tradeable insight**
  - include confidence tags: [High]/[Med]/[Low]

### 9) Actionable Watchlist (Next 1–2 Weeks)
- 10–15 high-signal catalysts (data, central bank, auctions, geopolitics, earnings clusters)
- For each: expected market sensitivity and likely cross-asset reaction map

### 10) Pending Economic Indicators (Week Ahead) (Required)
Include a compact forward calendar for the next 7 days:
- Date/time (Europe/London)
- Country/region
- Indicator/event name
- Importance: High / Medium / Low
- Consensus (if available)
- Why it matters (one line)

Output format:
- Group by day (Mon → Sun)
- Mark **high-impact** releases with `🔥`
- Add one final line: `Most market-moving window this week: ...`

### 11) Podcast Signal Check (Required)
Analyze selected podcasts for market-relevant signal.

Start with:
- **All-In Podcast (latest episode)**

For each episode analyzed, provide:
- Episode title + publication date
- 5–10 key points
- Market commentary extraction:
  - macro view
  - rates/inflation view
  - equities/tech view
  - crypto/AI/policy implications
- Actionable alpha:
  - 3–5 tradeable takeaways
  - confidence tags [High]/[Med]/[Low]
- Distinguish **signal vs noise/hot takes**

### 12) Earnings Transcript Signal (Required)
Pull and analyze latest earnings-call transcripts for the most systemically important US companies.

Default coverage basket (unless overridden):
- **Mega-cap core:** AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA
- **Macro bellwethers:** JPM, UNH, XOM, WMT

For each company, provide:
- Company + quarter/date of transcript
- 3–5 management takeaways (demand, pricing, margins, capex, guidance)
- **Change vs last quarter (Required):** what materially changed in management tone, guidance, demand commentary, or capex plans
- Tone score: Bullish / Neutral / Bearish
- Commentary tags: growth, inflation, labor, consumer health, enterprise spend, AI capex, credit stress
- One-line market implication

Then add:
- **Cross-company synthesis (5–10 bullets):** what is consistent vs diverging
- **US macro read-through:** what this basket implies for growth/inflation cycle
- **Actionable alpha:** 5–10 tradeable observations, each backed by **2+ independent signals**, with confidence tags [High]/[Med]/[Low]

### 13) Bottom Line (PM Decision Layer)
Provide:
- Base case (55–65%)
- Alternative case (20–30%)
- Tail case (5–15%)
- For each: what to overweight / underweight / hedge

---

## Style Constraints
- Target length: **900–1500 words**
- Crisp, information-dense, no generic textbook explanations
- Prefer bullets over long paragraphs
- Use confidence tags with explicit thresholds:
  - **[High]** = 3+ independent confirming signals
  - **[Med]** = 2 independent confirming signals
  - **[Low]** = 1 signal or mostly inferential/speculative
- Mark unverified claims explicitly
- No moralizing/disclaimers unless essential to risk framing

---

## Data Freshness
- Prefer latest available data at runtime
- Timestamp the brief at top as: `Generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (Europe/London)`
- If data is stale or missing, state gaps explicitly in one short section: `Data Caveats`

---

## Deliverable Naming
- Save final output as: `market-overview-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Also print directly in chat for quick read/edit.
